## General Approach

Several days of planning the wireframes, user stories, ERD and research into what's on tap locally.  I setup the client and API repos ahead, but did not start any coding until first day of project work.

I focused on the backend first getting each route tested before working on the client side.  I tested each feature as code was added or modified.

## Installation instructions

No customized installation instructions.

## User Stories

As a brewer, I want to signup/signin and list the beers that are currently on tap at my brewery so that we have informed guests.

As a brewer, I want to be able to update the list when the tap selection changes to attract new guests.

As a brewer, when I update my brewery’s beer list I want see an updated list to that I know updates have been made successfully.

As a craft beer drinker, I want to use What’s On Tap app to select my location and see what’s brewing nearby to plan my pub crawl.  List should show brewery, name of brew and style brew.

As a craft beer drinker, I want to filter by the type of beer I like so that I get to the breweries that have my favorite style beer.

As a craft beer drinker, after I click on a brew I want to link to google maps to see the location of the brewery so I know how to get there.

As a craft beer drinker, after I click on a brew I want to see a description of the brew to know more about the brewing details.
